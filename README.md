## About the project

This project uses the equations of motion of an aeroplane to plot the flight path. 
First, the aeroplane is treated as a glider (no thrust). The path is plotted with different initial conditions for the flight path angle and velocity. 

Second, the aeroplane equations include thrust. The path is plotted with different initial conditions for the flight path angle and velocity.

Last, the aeroplane longitudinal equations are used to determine the change in Velocity (V), flight path angle (gamma), angle of attack (alpha), pitch rate (q), altitude (h) and downpath (zeta)
